- The project can be cloned from GitHub via the following address:
  https://github.com/michelmay/Text2Transcription.git
  
- Since some files contain hard-coded phonetic symbols, please make sure
  to set your IDE's encoding to UTF-8 before opening any of them.
  In eclipse, got to Preferences -> General -> Content Types and set the
  'Default Encoding' to 'UTF-8', advisedly for every file type.
  After having launched T2T for the first time, got to
  Launch Configurations -> Java Application -> Text2Transcription -> Common 
  and change the 'Encoding' to UTF-8 as well.
- After exporting the project to a runnable .jar file, the following folders
  must be extracted from and located in the same directory with said .jar, 
  because the app expects them to be in that directory
  -> config
  -> images
  -> de/upb/t2t/gui
  After that, the class files inside those folders should also be removed 
  (for cosmetic reasons).
- The class de.upb.t2t.control.Statics inside the main source folder contains
  a helper functions. parseBoolean(String) comes in especially handy when 
  reading property strings from the MainControl instance.
- For developer convenience, the default properties file's content can be 
  restored with the help of the DefaultPropertiesSetter. It contains a 
  hard-coded version of its contents.
- For debugging purposes, the local SQLite file's tables can be re-created
  with their initial values (i.e. word classes, varieties, punctChars and
  currencyChars) but no lemmas or transcription items. The required SQLite 
  commands are stored as deprecated protected static Strings inside the 
  AbstractSQLiteBridge. The SQLiteBridgeDesktop contains a createTables plus
  a series of init methods with the help of which the tables can quickly be 
  restored.
- To export the JavaDoc, use the following command line arguments:
  -encoding "UTF-8" -docencoding "UTF-8" -charset "UTF-8" -Xdoclint:none
- PreparedStatements need be used to for the (desktop) SQLite queries / 
  updates, because special characters such as the ' will break the syntax.
